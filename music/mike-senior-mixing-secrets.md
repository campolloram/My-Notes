# Mike Senior - Mixing secrets for the small studio

NOTE: The first part of this book talks about the physical set-up for your studio (monitors, traps, room ressonance, etc.) I will be skipping that part since I only care for the actual mixing technique.

### Prepare your session
1. Organize your tracks.
    - Get used to a certain arrengement on your sessions e.g. Tracks 1-10 are drums, 11-15 synths, 16-20 vocals, etc.
2. Colors and symbols speak faster than words.
    - Get used labeling your tracks sensible and use colors to group them by. Pro tip. Use a weird color to remind yourself that a track needs fixing.
3. Divide the Timeline
    - Use the horizontal bar to divide your timeline into the different sections (intro, build-up, etc.) this is helpful for getting to know the song and jumping between sections quickly.

### Spotting trobble and hidden gems
1. Listen to each track individually
    - It's a good oportunity to cut out any silences in your audio/midi tracks since it makes the project easier to see.
    - You get to deal with unwanted background noise, audio glitches, etc.)
    - You can also add necessary crossfades and remove pops and bleeds. (making it smooth and clear)
    - It can help you to spot moments of magic or gems from a particular track that might have been buried by other layers in the mix.
