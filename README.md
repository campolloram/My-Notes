# My Notes
Hey everyone!

This repository contains my personal notes for different technologies I'm studying.



## AWS_Courses Directory
- This folder contains notes for the AWS certificates I plan to take. These notes are based of the courses made by Adrian Cantrill, full credit for all the media and information.

- You can find his courses in his webpage:

    - https://learn.cantrill.io/

**NOTE:** 
- If you search for "Exam" in the notes you can find possible exam questions as well as things to keep in mind.

**NOTE:** 
- Do a regex search of "^# " for jumping between topics
